The `edatoolsmkh` package is a demonstration project for learning how to build an R package. It comes from Chapter 22 of [R in Action (3rd ed)](https://www.manning.com/books/r-in-action-third-edition).

The package has one main function for describing a data frame and two generic functions.

```{r setup}
library(edatoolsmkh)
```

```{r example}
df_info <- contents(happiness)
print(df_info, digits = 4)
plot(df_info)
```
